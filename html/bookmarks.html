<h2 id="bottom"><u>COMPUTER</u></h2>
<a href ="#top">Go to Top</a>
<p>an electronic device which is capable of receiving information (data) in a particular form and of performing a sequence of operations in accordance with a predetermined but variable set of procedural instructions (program) to produce a result in the form of information or signals.</p>
<h2 id ="lee"><u>CPU</u></h2>
<p>CPU (pronounced as separate letters) is the abbreviation for central processing unit. Sometimes referred to simply as the central processor, but more commonly called processor, the CPU is the brains of the computer where most calculations take place.</p>
<h2 id = "hola"><u>ALU</u></h2>
<p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs.</p>
<h2 id ="ping"><u>Programming Languages</u></h2>
<p>A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="loop"><u>C</u></h2>
<p>C is a high-level and general purpose programming language that is ideal for developing firmware or portable applications. Originally intended for writing system software, C was developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix Operating System (OS) in the early 1970s.</p>
<h2 id="pong"><u>C++</u></h2>
<p>C++ is an object oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style."</p>
<h2 id= "par"><u>DBMS</u></h2>
<p>A database management system (DBMS) is system software for creating and managing databases. The DBMS provides users and programmers with a systematic way to create, retrieve, update and manage data.</p>
<h2 id="slop"><u>RDBMS</u></h2>
<p>RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access. A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd.</p>
<h2 id="pits"><u>OODBMS</u></h2>
<p>An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) is a database management system that supports the creation and modeling of data as objects. OODBMS also includes support for classes of objects and the inheritance of class properties, and incorporates methods, subclasses and their objects.</p>
<h2 id ="hd"><u>HDBMS</u></h2>
<p>HDBMS (Hierarchical Database Management System) is a type of DBMS that supports a hierarchical data model. Example HDBMS Systems: Lotus Notes (the most popular HDBMS in use today) IMS - IBM's Information Management System (first HDBMS)</p>
<h2 id="nw"><u>NDBMS</u></h2>
<p>Network Database Management System (NDBMS). The network
model makes an attempt to deal with many of the hierarchical model's limitations. A network database consists of a collection
of records connected to one another through links. Each record is a collection of fields (attributes), each of which contains only
one data value. A link is an association between precisely two records.</p>
